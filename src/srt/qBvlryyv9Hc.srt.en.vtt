 this hymn called keila menezes [Applause] 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.410
 [Music] and then 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:01:40.320
 mom justin honey because it is am i am me and 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.170
 and there and there 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:54.780
 good thank you hi good afternoon so i will talk about 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.220
 english feed yourself and iv my name is keila menezes fernandes this i work 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.900
 as a software consultant at totvs worx plus google develop expert 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.990
 in web technology and now also only volunteer at campinas front-end someone 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.860
 here it was at the front campinas this past year 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.300
 and then it sells a lot of masses, be sure to go next year. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.880
 generation with the intention of inserting people in technology is also 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.740
 writing an introductory book to engler and I am also part of the team 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.490
 corsas team which is a blog writes these things about web 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:49.090
 it's good to seek instant age is very important for how we user is going 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.780
 successfully interact with applications o and this whole ecosystem of frameworks 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.650
 has helped us to create applications that are more interactive helped our 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.040
 productivity with developer people creating kind of 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.640
 application but at the same time has brought a lot to see network in the sense that the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.430
 applications have to load many things and can be slow so question 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.800
 would we go back to vanilla ds at the same time we want to use all separate 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.110
 sign up or provide and also follow the evolution of the web because 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.350
 to keep your application more and more updated, but how will you do it? 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.330
 this without throwing away everything we did six months ago and that implies us 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.230
 maybe change our perspective a little bit if you ask you that that 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.370
 they image represents 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.250
 hi can come then 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.010
 and the other person who has it exactly because we already have our 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.390
 exposure company to think they are square because it's usually 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.359
 representation of what we see, but it could be easy for a cube coming 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.870
 seen from another perspective hi and then what would that be 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.000
 is an image of a cube and two dimensions 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.960
 hello good could also be the face of a quick logical test that we don't 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.610
 would have stuck in three dimensions and we would get summer tesseract 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.759
 well then the idea of ​​reuse it is not new in the 60s douglas 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.900
 michael spoke about the idea of ​​creating components based on architecture 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.500
 in components 50 years later brad for his ideas atomic design 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.520
 hi and the idea is that we can create several different component elements 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.010
 in different ways attendance of the framework keys for this but I don't 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.220
 I see no problem we create I think this diversity is important but 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.030
 consume in a single way hi and the one that sold the web component 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.440
 that you can create reusable elements encapsulated in any 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.370
 that is application and if you've stopped to analyze a 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.830
 element that a priori in that standard perspective that we think the 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:52.630
 input in the browser enabling us to gift in chrome you will see that in 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:00.560
 true the input in capsule a div hi and there but ok for what we 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.330
 will use the frameworks so right the documentation site hurts there 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.889
 he thinks content is just a static part and he doesn't use igor he is all 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:18.199
 static but for some parts that need more of these images to be 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:23.380
 more dynamic has more interactivity they go contronics webb 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.830
 hi what's up she sold her me what is she me the library from the angle you 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.940
 manages to encapsulate component elements to wrap in web components with the idea of 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.800
 you are able to use these components in whatever the 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.930
 agnostic application the framework and for this presentation I will create a 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.180
 a component that represents the comment that you can like it is 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:00.319
 very simple has a text has an author of the amount likes and the heart icon 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.740
 that you can click to like that comment you came from there 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:11.430
 just comment it works that way okay 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.810
 hi and then i have no challenge on twitter yesterday i don't know if you guys have seen it but it was 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.430
 participate I still think that until her but two three o'clock in the afternoon I don't think 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.490
 four more hours in the afternoon which is a challenge for what size you 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:35.970
 imagine that this would be the component there using aave aave compressed and then I 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:42.240
 I’m going to draw two people to retweet this one you’re in my 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:50.310
 my twitch and you will compete for this complete course of the ultimate corsa tô de 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.689
 bike that has these four young creed modes 

00:07:54.689 --> 00:08:00.509
 the good is how it would be so i create a component i will want a component 

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:05.369
 igor basics so i will define a template will define the styles but 

00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:13.019
 for me to create this component using the library it comes from i will define the 

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:17.849
 encapsulation of it will be tea dome type so I will have my simple that 

00:08:17.849 --> 00:08:26.189
 represents the text the author the amount of e-liquid likes i have an event that 

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:32.819
 will change the value of my liquid so that component is the temple 

00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:38.129
 it will display the text I will have the footer part that will have quantity 

00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:44.310
 lakes my heart icon i can i'm going to set an event that is going to call the 

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.950
 hi toboggan and how this application swallows 

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:55.770
 it is not a common application so i will define this component in my 

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.960
 between the component so that it does not boot and as a normal component 

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:07.860
 which is commonly done, right and not a builder, I'm going to use this create 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.890
 custom it lies that it is a function of the library and then I will define the editor 

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.820
 so that I have distances independent of this component and shoot 

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.970
 zana and joke cost it is i will use define which will be the selector o the tag 

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.390
 html that i'm going to use to use the components and other applications and i 

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:33.870
 need to create this put this ng-bootstrap method so that this application does not 

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:39.810
 to be initialized with common application is good to build i will bring a 

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:46.439
 I liked it there and obviously only that in the command of engebuild - prod I will add 

00:09:46.439 --> 00:09:54.120
 this parameter out put hard noni for here do not put the régis in the games 

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.620
 chilled hi and then I'll get all those 

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:05.010
 chilled young people and I will pack them using nude so I will simply 

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.550
 generate in my folder is elements it ended with me dejas un 

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:16.510
 hi and to facilitate isolation of this component of fever she is mind me 

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:23.230
 set on my jason feet a teske right to make the bild is elements that then I 

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:29.440
 use these two these engebuild commands counted those parameters and the 

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:35.680
 that goes to tell all this in the only javscript already has to I can do that already 

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.269
 have to attack for that have to still x bill after that facilitates all this 

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:43.839
 work but I'm doing it manually that later I want to play with these 

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:50.740
 files that I'm going to package hi and to use it's like using 

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:58.430
 any common element, right, that uses html so set the properties 

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.700
 just demonstrate here how it would be 

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:12.399
 oh ok i have ok to see well no 

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:19.150
 well then i'm going to have to go html here 

00:11:21.939 --> 00:11:27.669
 good so i'm importing that javascript is that i want two 

00:11:27.669 --> 00:11:36.170
 I’m going to comment and we’ll see here so I have my 

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.570
 component to interact with it only what time the 

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.850
 size 177 baskets 

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.880
 and I didn't like it very much so I said like this let's think about other 

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.920
 options is because it happens because it 

00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.130
 need to bring all the dependencies of the going there also has a sound file 

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.750
 s that is to make change detection hurt there so all of this is going 

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:10.750
 in my band or generated right, we are the minimum number of young people 

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:18.460
 cript only that doesn’t have the basics to load this component so this is the 

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.400
 The idea of ​​having only what is necessary to determine the parts of the application is not 

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.070
 something new, like going there he has the issue of modules that uses strategy 

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:35.170
 on-demand loading which are the lazy-load modules then for the pef to 

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:40.750
 a route I define that certain module that has all the components 

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.890
 all the elements that I need to load that route will only be 

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:53.129
 loaded start that ipef hi or else the change itself that had 

00:12:53.129 --> 00:12:57.509
 in relation to the service and version of the classes we use so that we don’t have 

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:01.579
 logic directly related to visualization how to do here are http 

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:07.080
 so in this service, the service had to be defined in the modules 

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.240
 it's just that there has to be a change part of the same as you use that decorate 

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.790
 a class with a good injector at sign and you allow you to do three sheik at the level of 

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.420
 good provaider so these are several strategies to 

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.430
 we will even have a presentation here in the js building that will be a rescue that 

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.330
 are all thinking about treaties that we can do to carry only 

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.260
 with the necessary to determine the application parts right 

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:41.740
 hi and then live appears in this context a new rendering engine error 

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.950
 generalization moto windows is a software that will do all the drawing part 

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.940
 texts and images in the case of the web application we will usually have to have 

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:57.670
 my l with the css styles and then you say wow but again it will change because 

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:03.730
 i know people have a lot of trauma that came from ingrid s that changed and 

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.830
 I will have to present all applications I will have to throw everything away 

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:16.960
 google itself uses in 600 applications the latest version of the master that 

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:23.160
 it was hurting my jaw there so once we are going to enable hiv to be the default 

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.880
 how the application rendering engine is the same for all applications 

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.170
 have to change, have to pass all the tests so he has a concern 

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:38.540
 great with compatibility and hiv but mostly what the 

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.460
 today we will have a lecture of the heroes he will talk about hiv but 

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:49.610
 in detail I wanted to have today this is it here you can enable hiv is a 

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:55.490
 person opt in only i'm going to do something different so this here with a 

00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:01.220
 experiment that I did for two weeks that the contribution of her mind 

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.960
 for the new live design 

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:14.020
 hi and how would it be if we had already integrated i've with her mind that in 

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.690
 truth are actually are you have igor components and encapsulated by web 

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:27.400
 component would be you could have a wii ng-component that you are would put your 

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:33.040
 component would define that I showed how it is today in the element only that it still doesn't 

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:40.150
 there is this was a suggestion that the hurting team brought her in india to check this 

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:47.050
 year because it swallows you a lot so the hurting team is to share with 

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.130
 community the ideas they are having so that we can achieve 

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:57.370
 contribute the feedback on it so I started from the following observation 

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:03.430
 today I raised some hypotheses I did my experiments and I'm going to share 

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:08.760
 analysis of this experiments with you throughout the entire code that I will show 

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.050
 here is in the middle ruby ​​kit is exactly the same my name is with two elles one 

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.850
 project in ai heaven on 

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:24.720
 hi and this is an implementation but I don't want you to get attached to 

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:34.350
 solution but to the problem how to create how to create web applications that are more 

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.980
 instant 

00:16:37.139 --> 00:16:41.399
 is because it doesn’t matter we just understand why we’re doing it but why 

00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:46.920
 we are doing this is a disruptive approach and we are at a conference 

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.980
 of technology this is technology this is to be supplementary 

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.730
 good so to start that that i'm going to do i'm going to do everything manually 

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:02.279
 because i don't have that ng-component iv yet so i'm going to create 

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:06.240
 a class that extended html it lies with all that textual properties 

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.939
 tolix liquid there i need to define the two methods observe is tribute i 

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:18.620
 callback tax for each of these attributes of mine and then I'm going to use 

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:24.949
 still to stick and deprived of the live even has a ceiling there in the methods 

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:30.480
 so I'm going to import the two methods the income ceiling is component if the part of 

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.799
 version eight ok i'm using one there and the ones to call it component income 

00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:43.799
 only and for the ceiling of tec teens these tektites and then to render this 

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:47.320
 component and I just go to the constructor 

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.550
 of that because this class it two-component that will cover my 

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.540
 language component only for child component I will not create the way with 

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:02.360
 the pattern I will import I have dynamic import so I have there awaiting 

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.690
 import the file path and then the component network and return an instance of 

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:13.190
 my component i define the face and says why it will be stuck on that side 

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.780
 component and then I define all the properties and manually call the 

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:25.240
 detectchanges in my hi component and then in that one in my file that 

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:31.120
 I'm packing, it's generating bild, I'm not going to put the priest wires because 

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.680
 I don't want it I prefer it in this case it has the importing sony part I don't 

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.570
 I need this more with live because the change detection has totally changed the 

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:45.610
 how it will be done hi and then when it opened I will see that 

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:51.730
 in addition to all those already clips that generate in the application will have a separate one that I 

00:18:51.730 --> 00:19:00.160
 read here comment component cause it's taking s5 s6 the javascript and here we go 

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.000
 see what happens here 

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:11.800
 well then there for this one I called there I saw lazy lazy eye I saw that I have and if 

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.170
 import dynamic I'm just going to define a button here on this button I'm 

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.290
 calling this function is from there i'm going to comedy that i put in this file 

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.320
 javascript to do what you want to trigger will hit some 

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.070
 properties and will give a service on my body 

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:33.320
 and I only have a button I don't have the distance here in this component's html 

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:41.610
 and then all right here he loaded my pack loaded that javascript just has 

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:47.040
 the function that makes you learn and there’s nothing else but when I click here 

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:53.060
 it will create a web component that capsules the component me there I saw 

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:59.000
 centralized with vivi and only then did he load javascript 

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.530
 o and attached the component cannot dynamically right 

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.309
 and there it is and how can he work 

00:20:12.309 --> 00:20:18.370
 so I saw why it has the concept of locality today when a compilation 

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.500
 is done in the language he has to analyze all the dependencies he needs to have a 

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:29.919
 global knowledge of the application as a bird concept and this is going to change and this 

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:33.850
 implies what I'm going to be able to accomplish the fragile component talking about 

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:39.470
 much easier than what is done without live and the modules in English they 

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:45.680
 historically strip was the role and very important in the context of compiling 

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.020
 all the elements that we use parent directives for the components of a 

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.730
 and then for me written a lot of things if you start using swallow for the first 

00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:01.880
 time is one of the most difficult concepts and is essential because an application is equal to 

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:07.340
 characterized by being modular but with this concept of live this form of 

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:13.010
 compilation you will not need to declare I had no module that does not 

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:17.000
 I liked it, there was no mode in that application, no mode. 

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.640
 my component no way the molds already so until they become obsolete 

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:29.720
 hi and then how do we do that he creates aesthetic definitions each with 

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:36.260
 each component each directive each country the injected ones will all have a file 

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:42.520
 typescript with definitions with pure rendering-related functions 

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:51.010
 creating all of these elements good so it creates a syntax tree 

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:58.180
 abstract that represents that static definition updating the tone today as it is 

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:04.420
 made without live we have the html template from the html temperature that is 

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:09.160
 depending on the color heitor creates all the metadata that represents that 

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:16.180
 component and there is an atomic unit that I roll interpreter that it will 

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:21.929
 be responsible for distancing my component for updating my component 

00:22:21.929 --> 00:22:30.179
 and to add it in the gift and this is the code that has in the functions that everyone 

00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:34.830
 English elements pass through the rendering process that mars out 

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:41.610
 I don't see this giant suite code so all the elements down by the same 

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:48.929
 execution path depending on 15 component case directive but for example 

00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:53.249
 for this application I'm only using the component, but for the one from her 

00:22:53.249 --> 00:22:56.440
 had to import all this all this code 

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.150
 and today how is it with hiv how would be the definition of that which component this 

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.550
 class it has the component type the selectors that represents that 

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:12.160
 component the milk time that a function and a factor that will be will be mine 

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.800
 entire component statically defined in that class definition is descriptive 

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:24.520
 and then I can update the gift incrementally is an html template 

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.630
 to present my component but I don't have the metadata anymore I don't need 

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:33.430
 plus that regular interpreting I only have the instructions these situations 

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.470
 static and the situation part updates the gift 

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.960
 hi and then we can do it I left it here in a much more efficient way 

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.760
 that I let us as we already know we don’t put in our 

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.200
 our band functions that are not used for example but with this 

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.490
 concept of the ipad location we will be able to make a concept at the 

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.380
 dependency i will show example have for example i have here mess with the 

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.340
 traditional I have this class that imports two functions just told me that 

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.780
 you said you had in my method i invoke samsung together i'm calling the 

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:15.450
 another one will not be in my pack now imagine that I have this more grandson who 

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:20.730
 is receive as a parameter exam candle that is a boolean and then I invoke you told me 

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.170
 that had more I'm just going to call a chance suffocation this future value 

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.570
 it's like saying that our question in my application I always focus on one 

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:35.790
 meter of passing false only that this sad analysis which is static it will 

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.570
 add all two functions from my pack one 

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.590
 good so for example here let's see how the function definition would be 

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:48.360
 template for this component the simple component that has an input name 

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.950
 that receives a good variable so this definition of that 

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.659
 component would have the template function of the code blocks one to create and 

00:24:57.659 --> 00:25:01.980
 treatment then it uses this function of the start mind and another one to update 

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:06.720
 because the name can be variable, I also need to run the detection of 

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:13.350
 changes and you will be able to make you put a break point and you are 

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:17.639
 actually debugging how component change detection is done 

00:25:17.639 --> 00:25:25.639
 used with live only let's say i invoke this component with the name 

00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:29.639
 which is a value a fixed value the sherlock cases 

00:25:29.639 --> 00:25:35.669
 and how would the template function of the definition of that component only have the 

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:39.470
 block to create and the sad thing here is done at the level of 

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.550
 dependency it will not add the block that updates because you said no 

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:49.480
 never changes an elementary 

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:56.530
 well then we know that the band is smaller and very efficient and all that 

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:01.600
 is being possible because of these static definitions that are created 

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.420
 to represent these elements good and is that I love you within that 

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.330
 monolith interpreter we saw that side function wanted to see you for 

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.260
 individual instructions 

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:23.030
 it is only here that first because I showed you that I generated 

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:30.980
 javscript of that mind of 177 cabaites the second gave 125k bytes and in 

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:38.150
 truth has a reduction of thirty percent that was I thought with import 

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:44.570
 dynamic was going to be less than with tactical import was the second hypothesis I made 

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:49.690
 the more I showed you here now good and if you compare the tchan that 

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:56.500
 that separate file he tried a job but compared to 125 below until 

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.470
 negligible value of it so if i think you will have to carry 

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:06.970
 regardless of whether you use the new component this 125 channels it happens 

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:13.260
 because why the trench that what happens to your foot that makes the normal sheik 

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.850
 with dynamic import it's not as efficient 

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:22.340
 hi and then i put a static matter so i'm importing my 

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:30.010
 fan i will eat or commit component hi and then i will not use the import 

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.840
 dynamic I will simply call the render 

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:40.280
 and then we'll see and how it would be here so I will have here the 

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.480
 even though it gives html only I will not be creating fly line I will 

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.679
 add it right here 

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:56.770
 and here I have these two components and the size of it gives 39 heads and 

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:04.390
 this is a seventy percent reduction compared to using the 

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:08.029
 dynamic sport to render the angry component 

00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:13.099
 and we will compare then how it would be from the first is a strategy to the 

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:21.499
 second and the last first thing is mind 187 end up compressing 55 the bike with the 

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:28.639
 dynamic sport option 125 cabs compressed 43 below and have a sport 

00:28:28.639 --> 00:28:34.389
 dynamic 39 and compressed 

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:46.040
 15 fights 15k bytes in 15 15 couples 

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:53.330
 yes it is and here I had all that manual work to create another 

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:59.470
 component in hand call the hiv to rendered have that are of changes 

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:05.030
 obviously the hurting team already has this vision that you will be able to create 

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.000
 of components using it but we don't have it ready 

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.920
 implementation was just for us to have an idea of ​​what will be possible to be done 

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:18.740
 that would be a suggestion and it was also from india confiding that it would be having a 

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:25.160
 new of the color heitor ng she is mind and this one of the color heitor set selector 

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.850
 plate the probable the dependents at the level of dependence because sometimes 

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.470
 you use an and if and you have a door in all your at sign swallows that 

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:38.270
 all the definitions you will define the dependencies right in your component 

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:45.670
 but this is still something that is being studied if it is going to be that way 

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:53.250
 is so wanted to bring this new person you have is how to carry 

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:59.090
 applications to take more instant be more efficient 

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:08.750
 and that's it you know we have created a lot for technology science has 

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:15.560
 evolved already form sensational and so it is a step but there is no right step 

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:21.050
 don't do it wrong because all the steps will take us are part of our 

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:24.860
 journey and I will take us to what we want to build knowledge 

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.570
 science if you notice everything we can connect a person today 

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:33.680
 from one point in the world to another point in the world we have an image of a 

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.340
 black hole o and all these are just tools 

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:44.289
 we should never put the tools above our principles 

00:30:44.289 --> 00:30:50.169
 above what we really want to obtain and as technologies we are these 

00:30:50.169 --> 00:30:55.360
 path recorders i really like when they say i'm an engineer who 

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.049
 we are engineers because we build things not physically 

00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:05.519
 bridges the building used but we build this journey for knowledge 

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:15.260
 thank you [Applause] 

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.660
 what's up
