data-start="1344.909" data-end="1347.159">first of all and foremost microphone 10</span> <span data-start="1347.159" data-end="1349.08">is not a component is a representation</span> <span data-start="1349.08" data-end="1350.19">of a sub-domain</span> <span data-start="1350.19" data-end="1352.44">that is matching exactly the structure</span> <span data-start="1352.44" data-end="1355.649">of our organization its technology and</span> <span data-start="1355.649" data-end="1357.419">framework agnostic as I said where I can</span> <span data-start="1357.419" data-end="1358.98">develop a one microphone tending one</span> <span data-start="1358.98" data-end="1360.69">technology and use another one for</span> <span data-start="1360.69" data-end="1363.629">another microphone then each microphone</span> <span data-start="1363.629" data-end="1365.669">tend expose a lifecycle method that is</span> <span data-start="1365.669" data-end="1367.289">used by the bootstrap when we want to</span> <span data-start="1367.289" data-end="1369.72">unload the micro front end or mount</span> <span data-start="1369.72" data-end="1371.22">amount from tenon doing some things</span> <span data-start="1371.22" data-end="1374.759">inside that each team inside the</span> <span data-start="1374.759" data-end="1376.649">microphone can can share components code</span> <span data-start="1376.649" data-end="1378.809">style any other stuff like that but they</span> <span data-start="1378.809" data-end="1381.149">cannot do that outside the microphone</span> <span data-start="1381.149" data-end="1382.86">tent because that is going to slow down</span> <span data-start="1382.86" data-end="1384.629">everything I work in a lot of large</span> <span data-start="1384.629" data-end="1386.85">organization managing hundreds of</span> <span data-start="1386.85" data-end="1389.34">developers and when you start to</span> <span data-start="1389.34" data-end="1390.96">abstract and have a team that is</span> <span data-start="1390.96" data-end="1392.82">centralizing code is where the</span> <span data-start="1392.82" data-end="1396">throughput is a going nuts because we</span> <span data-start="1396" data-end="1398.549">you start to have a centralized version</span> <span data-start="1398.549" data-end="1400.59">of your code and every time if you need</span> <span data-start="1400.59" data-end="1402.12">to change you need to do a number and</span> <span data-start="1402.12" data-end="1403.83">additional abstraction the code became</span> <span data-start="1403.83" data-end="1405.36">more difficult to maintain and the</span> <span data-start="1405.36" data-end="1408.12">six-month time the throughput is gone we</span> <span data-start="1408.12" data-end="1410.37">studied this way we can isolate the team</span> <span data-start="1410.37" data-end="1411.779">that can pick the data can take their</span> <span data-start="1411.779" data-end="1414.33">own decision and they can innovate</span> <span data-start="1414.33" data-end="1416.46">inside that the other interesting thing</span> <span data-start="1416.46" data-end="1418.47">with this we can test different building</span> <span data-start="1418.47" data-end="1420.179">systems one microphone 10 could be brick</span> <span data-start="1420.179" data-end="1422.639">there could be let's say build with I</span> <span data-start="1422.639" data-end="1424.47">don't know web pack or another one with</span> <span data-start="1424.47" data-end="1426.929">parcel and and so on so we can really</span> <span data-start="1426.929" data-end="1429.299">have a less a granularity of choice that</span> <span data-start="1429.299" data-end="1432.6">we can do with as this is brilliant so</span> <span data-start="1432.6" data-end="1434.61">what we achieve so first of all that is</span> <span data-start="1434.61" data-end="1436.919">for me pretty interesting we were able</span> <span data-start="1436.919" data-end="1438.09">to to onboard</span> <span data-start="1438.09" data-end="1440.159">five teams unless in a couple of weeks</span> <span data-start="1440.159" data-end="1442.799">time so after the first week they were</span> <span data-start="1442.799" data-end="1444.69">able immediately to contribute the</span> <span data-start="1444.69" data-end="1446.37">codebase because they are completely</span> <span data-start="1446.37" data-end="1448.46">independent they don't have to wait for</span> <span data-start="1448.46" data-end="1450.779">understand deeply the architecture they</span> <span data-start="1450.779" data-end="1452.039">have like their own single page</span> <span data-start="1452.039" data-end="1453.419">application that is really tiny and</span> <span data-start="1453.419" data-end="1455.19">small the domain is more they can</span> <span data-start="1455.19" data-end="1457.2">understand the domain deeply and then</span> <span data-start="1457.2" data-end="1458.82">they can they can go and I start to work</span> <span data-start="1458.82" data-end="1459.6">on that</span> <span data-start="1459.6" data-end="1461.83">we have currently over a hundred of</span> <span data-start="1461.83" data-end="1463.45">developers that are working on the same</span> <span data-start="1463.45" data-end="1465.55">code base that is brilliant because I</span> <span data-start="1465.55" data-end="1467.11">also in a distributed way because we</span> <span data-start="1467.11" data-end="1468.76">have people in in Poland we have people</span> <span data-start="1468.76" data-end="1470.65">in London and we are we are opening</span> <span data-start="1470.65" data-end="1472.21">right now and you dev Center in after</span> <span data-start="1472.21" data-end="1475.03">them and and that is one of the power of</span> <span data-start="1475.03" data-end="1478.45">this finally that the developers have</span> <span data-start="1478.45" data-end="1480.58">the freedom as possibility to innovate</span> <span data-start="1480.58" data-end="1483.37">and owning the code end-to-end and not</span> <span data-start="1483.37" data-end="1485.68">just part of that because often too</span> <span data-start="1485.68" data-end="1487.96">often architects are thinking just on</span> <span data-start="1487.96" data-end="1490">the API layer but it's not the API layer</span> <span data-start="1490" data-end="1492.25">that is that the complex one because</span> <span data-start="1492.25" data-end="1495.79">currently we have a lot of let's say way</span> <span data-start="1495.79" data-end="1497.95">and and patterns and architecture that</span> <span data-start="1497.95" data-end="1499.72">could help us to to scale it up but</span> <span data-start="1499.72" data-end="1502.78">forefront and we don't have much so if</span> <span data-start="1502.78" data-end="1504.4">you want to start to look deeply on</span> <span data-start="1504.4" data-end="1506.11">microphone dance I pick these two</span> <span data-start="1506.11" data-end="1507.7">products there aren't many as I've seen</span> <span data-start="1507.7" data-end="1510.67">as I've showed before you can have like</span> <span data-start="1510.67" data-end="1512.29">an open components there are other ways</span> <span data-start="1512.29" data-end="1514.57">to do that like Taylor which is but the</span> <span data-start="1514.57" data-end="1516.25">two things that for me are closer to my</span> <span data-start="1516.25" data-end="1517.78">mind's that are are these two framework</span> <span data-start="1517.78" data-end="1521.44">one is single SBA that is not well known</span> <span data-start="1521.44" data-end="1523.18">but is providing a structure that is</span> <span data-start="1523.18" data-end="1524.32">very similar to what we are built</span> <span data-start="1524.32" data-end="1526.33">unfortunately discover that too late in</span> <span data-start="1526.33" data-end="1529.06">the process process like a year or a</span> <span data-start="1529.06" data-end="1530.53">year after that we started to work on</span> <span data-start="1530.53" data-end="1533.41">this but it is a really interesting one</span> <span data-start="1533.41" data-end="1536.08">and then flimsy as fringes provides a</span> <span data-start="1536.08" data-end="1538.03">slightly more flexibility and then</span> <span data-start="1538.03" data-end="1542.62">freedom we compared to single SBA but is</span> <span data-start="1542.62" data-end="1544.21">still another interesting one is</span> <span data-start="1544.21" data-end="1546.19">leveraging reactive programming behind</span> <span data-start="1546.19" data-end="1548.05">the scene and you can create components</span> <span data-start="1548.05" data-end="1551.14">with different with different frameworks</span> <span data-start="1551.14" data-end="1554.14">and the fringe is will let's say collect</span> <span data-start="1554.14" data-end="1556.33">them and show them inside their ask a</span> <span data-start="1556.33" data-end="1558.28">folder so this is an interesting one as</span> <span data-start="1558.28" data-end="1562.23">well in order to wrap up I would like to</span> <span data-start="1562.23" data-end="1564.49">just summarize what we have seen till</span> <span data-start="1564.49" data-end="1567.37">now so when we scale from 10 application</span> <span data-start="1567.37" data-end="1569.41">the problem is not scaling</span> <span data-start="1569.41" data-end="1571.51">infrastructure is scaling the teams and</span> <span data-start="1571.51" data-end="1573.22">we have to take in consideration this</span> <span data-start="1573.22" data-end="1575.74">because it's very very important to have</span> <span data-start="1575.74" data-end="1577.99">the right fruit put to reduce the</span> <span data-start="1577.99" data-end="1580.17">communication of rather between teams</span> <span data-start="1580.17" data-end="1583.84">last but not least often developers are</span> <span data-start="1583.84" data-end="1585.58">moving from one company to another one</span> <span data-start="1585.58" data-end="1587.86">and I don't know how is the the the</span> <span data-start="1587.86" data-end="1590.11">industry here but in London they they</span> <span data-start="1590.11" data-end="1591.49">are changing more or less every year</span> <span data-start="1591.49" data-end="1593.02">year and a half</span> <span data-start="1593.02" data-end="1594.07">mainly because they want to try</span> <span data-start="1594.07" data-end="1596.2">something new but we microphone talents</span> <span data-start="1596.2" data-end="1598.78">you are basically providing them what</span> <span data-start="1598.78" data-end="1599.83">they are looking for inside the</span> <span data-start="1599.83" data-end="1602.32">organization and also it could be a good</span> <span data-start="1602.32" data-end="1605.98">way to retain people last but not least</span> </p>
