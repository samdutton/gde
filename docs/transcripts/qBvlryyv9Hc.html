data-start="1368.929" data-end="1373.249">for this application I'm only using the component, but for the one from her</span> <span data-start="1373.249" data-end="1376.44">had to import all this all this code</span> <span data-start="1376.44" data-end="1381.15">and today how is it with hiv how would be the definition of that which component this</span> <span data-start="1381.15" data-end="1386.55">class it has the component type the selectors that represents that</span> <span data-start="1386.55" data-end="1392.16">component the milk time that a function and a factor that will be will be mine</span> <span data-start="1392.16" data-end="1397.8">entire component statically defined in that class definition is descriptive</span> <span data-start="1397.8" data-end="1404.52">and then I can update the gift incrementally is an html template</span> <span data-start="1404.52" data-end="1408.63">to present my component but I don't have the metadata anymore I don't need</span> <span data-start="1408.63" data-end="1413.43">plus that regular interpreting I only have the instructions these situations</span> <span data-start="1413.43" data-end="1417.47">static and the situation part updates the gift</span> <span data-start="1417.47" data-end="1421.96">hi and then we can do it I left it here in a much more efficient way</span> <span data-start="1421.96" data-end="1427.76">that I let us as we already know we don’t put in our</span> <span data-start="1427.76" data-end="1432.2">our band functions that are not used for example but with this</span> <span data-start="1432.2" data-end="1436.49">concept of the ipad location we will be able to make a concept at the</span> <span data-start="1436.49" data-end="1441.38">dependency i will show example have for example i have here mess with the</span> <span data-start="1441.38" data-end="1445.34">traditional I have this class that imports two functions just told me that</span> <span data-start="1445.34" data-end="1449.78">you said you had in my method i invoke samsung together i'm calling the</span> <span data-start="1449.78" data-end="1455.45">another one will not be in my pack now imagine that I have this more grandson who</span> <span data-start="1455.45" data-end="1460.73">is receive as a parameter exam candle that is a boolean and then I invoke you told me</span> <span data-start="1460.73" data-end="1465.17">that had more I'm just going to call a chance suffocation this future value</span> <span data-start="1465.17" data-end="1470.57">it's like saying that our question in my application I always focus on one</span> <span data-start="1470.57" data-end="1475.79">meter of passing false only that this sad analysis which is static it will</span> <span data-start="1475.79" data-end="1479.57">add all two functions from my pack one</span> <span data-start="1479.57" data-end="1483.59">good so for example here let's see how the function definition would be</span> <span data-start="1483.59" data-end="1488.36">template for this component the simple component that has an input name</span> <span data-start="1488.36" data-end="1492.95">that receives a good variable so this definition of that</span> <span data-start="1492.95" data-end="1497.659">component would have the template function of the code blocks one to create and</span> <span data-start="1497.659" data-end="1501.98">treatment then it uses this function of the start mind and another one to update</span> <span data-start="1501.98" data-end="1506.72">because the name can be variable, I also need to run the detection of</span> <span data-start="1506.72" data-end="1513.35">changes and you will be able to make you put a break point and you are</span> <span data-start="1513.35" data-end="1517.639">actually debugging how component change detection is done</span> <span data-start="1517.639" data-end="1525.639">used with live only let's say i invoke this component with the name</span> <span data-start="1525.639" data-end="1529.639">which is a value a fixed value the sherlock cases</span> <span data-start="1529.639" data-end="1535.669">and how would the template function of the definition of that component only have the</span> <span data-start="1535.669" data-end="1539.47">block to create and the sad thing here is done at the level of</span> <span data-start="1539.47" data-end="1543.55">dependency it will not add the block that updates because you said no</span> <span data-start="1543.55" data-end="1549.48">never changes an elementary</span> <span data-start="1549.48" data-end="1556.53">well then we know that the band is smaller and very efficient and all that</span> <span data-start="1556.53" data-end="1561.6">is being possible because of these static definitions that are created</span> <span data-start="1561.6" data-end="1566.42">to represent these elements good and is that I love you within that</span> <span data-start="1566.42" data-end="1572.33">monolith interpreter we saw that side function wanted to see you for</span> <span data-start="1572.33" data-end="1575.26">individual instructions</span> <span data-start="1575.89" data-end="1583.03">it is only here that first because I showed you that I generated</span> <span data-start="1583.03" data-end="1590.98">javscript of that mind of 177 cabaites the second gave 125k bytes and in</span> <span data-start="1590.98" data-end="1598.15">truth has a reduction of thirty percent that was I thought with import</span> <span data-start="1598.15" data-end="1604.57">dynamic was going to be less than with tactical import was the second hypothesis I made</span> <span data-start="1604.57" data-end="1609.69">the more I showed you here now good and if you compare the tchan that</span> <span data-start="1609.69" data-end="1616.5">that separate file he tried a job but compared to 125 below until</span> <span data-start="1616.5" data-end="1619.47">negligible value of it so if i think you will have to carry</span> <span data-start="1619.47" data-end="1626.97">regardless of whether you use the new component this 125 channels it happens</span> <span data-start="1626.97" data-end="1633.26">because why the trench that what happens to your foot that makes the normal sheik</span> <span data-start="1633.26" data-end="1636.85">with dynamic import it's not as efficient</span> <span data-start="1636.85" data-end="1642.34">hi and then i put a static matter so i'm importing my</span> <span data-start="1642.34" data-end="1650.01">fan i will eat or commit component hi and then i will not use the import</span> <span data-start="1650.01" data-end="1653.84">dynamic I will simply call the render</span> <span data-start="1653.84" data-end="1660.28">and then we'll see and how it would be here so I will have here the</span> <span data-start="1660.28" data-end="1664.48">even though it gives html only I will not be creating fly line I will</span> <span

the hiv to rendered have that are of changes</span> <span data-start="1739.47" data-end="1745.03">obviously the hurting team already has this vision that you will be able to create</span> <span data-start="1745.03" data-end="1748">of components using it but we don't have it ready</span> <span data-start="1748" data-end="1752.92">implementation was just for us to have an idea of ​​what will be possible to be done</span> <span data-start="1752.92" data-end="1758.74">that would be a suggestion and it was also from india confiding that it would be having a</span> <span data-start="1758.74"

has</span> <span data-start="1808.75" data-end="1815.56">evolved already form sensational and so it is a step but there is no right step</span> <span data-start="1815.56" data-end="1821.05">don't do
