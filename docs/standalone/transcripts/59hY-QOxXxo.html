gonna be I'm gonna assume</span> <span data-start="2409.33" data-end="2413.13">there's a method here that says like</span> <span data-start="2413.13" data-end="2416.74">activate or so something a custom method</span> <span data-start="2416.74" data-end="2418.9">that you want to call when this page has</span> <span data-start="2418.9" data-end="2420.76">rendered you can do it with first up</span> <span data-start="2420.76" data-end="2422.56">updated but I just want to show you</span> <span data-start="2422.56" data-end="2424.15">something that has to do with</span> <span data-start="2424.15" data-end="2426.64">performance and web components so I'm</span> <span data-start="2426.64" data-end="2428.02">just gonna say console the debug</span> <span data-start="2428.02" data-end="2433.93">activate was hold and go back to the</span> <span data-start="2433.93" data-end="2441.94">index import this to app stock reload</span> <span data-start="2441.94" data-end="2444.58">the page we're gonna have up stock it</span> <span data-start="2444.58" data-end="2447.61">works and the nice thing about our</span> <span data-start="2447.61" data-end="2449.47">components is that they are just HTML</span> <span data-start="2449.47" data-end="2452.35">elements with their own properties and</span> <span data-start="2452.35" data-end="2454.66">methods so if you find the app stock you</span> <span data-start="2454.66" data-end="2456.73">can call activate on it which is my own</span> <span data-start="2456.73" data-end="2460.35">custom method and that works great</span> <span data-start="2460.35" data-end="2464.08">activate was called until you decide you</span> <span data-start="2464.08" data-end="2465.91">start having a lot of components and you</span> <span data-start="2465.91" data-end="2468.46">want to lazy load them but thankfully</span> <span data-start="2468.46" data-end="2471.34">it's very easy you just import as a</span> <span data-start="2471.34" data-end="2474.79">function this is a browser feature you</span> <span data-start="2474.79" data-end="2476.56">can use it in all browsers but if you</span> <span data-start="2476.56" data-end="2478.21">have what park or parcel it takes care</span> <span data-start="2478.21" data-end="2480.7">of Polly filling it there may be one</span> <span data-start="2480.7" data-end="2482.68">browser missing it I'm missing from it</span> <span data-start="2482.68" data-end="2486.19">yet you just import it and then you can</span> <span data-start="2486.19" data-end="2488.98">have a promise when it actually loads</span> <span data-start="2488.98" data-end="2493.03">and it works but this is gonna break now</span> <span data-start="2493.03" data-end="2495.28">because at the moment this is running</span> <span data-start="2495.28" data-end="2499.57">app stock doesn't exist so you can do it</span> <span data-start="2499.57" data-end="2501.64">in multiple ways you can you can do it</span> <span data-start="2501.64" data-end="2503.68">with the dog down here I just want to</span> <span data-start="2503.68" data-end="2505.36">show you another method with custom</span> <span data-start="2505.36" data-end="2507.21">elements because other code grows</span> <span data-start="2507.21" data-end="2509.83">sometimes you don't have access to this</span> <span data-start="2509.83"

data-end="2518.89">custom elements dot anyone guess it yes</span> <span data-start="2518.89" data-end="2519.71">yes</span> <span data-start="2519.71" data-end="2522.56">one defined and you give it the name of</span> <span data-start="2522.56" data-end="2524.27">the app stock and this is basically</span> <span data-start="2524.27" data-end="2526.25">returning a promise that will only</span> <span
